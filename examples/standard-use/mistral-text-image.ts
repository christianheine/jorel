  // V-shaped design. The man has short, dark hair and a serious
  // expression on his face. The background appears to be a dimly lit,
  // possibly industrial or technological setting, which adds to the
  // overall sci-fi aesthetic of the image. The lighting highlights
  // the man and his suit, making them the focal point of the image.
